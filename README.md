## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load and clean the dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Apply feature engineering techniques.
4. Train multiple regression models.
5. Evaluate and compare models using RMSE, MAE, and R².
6. Deploy the best model for real-time prediction (optional).

## 📈 Results

* Best-performing model: `Gradient Boosting` with RMSE of X and R² of Y.
* Visual comparison of actual vs. predicted prices.

---

## 🚀 Future Work

* Incorporate time-series trends.
* Use more geographic and economic features.
* Improve performance with hyperparameter tuning or deep learning.
